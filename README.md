This is an Anki add-on that adds support for pasting clipboard content stored in Chrome's [Web custom formats](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/web-custom-formats-for-the-async-clipboard-api/). All media formats supported by Anki should work.

See the [demo][demo] subfolder for an example of how Web sites can take advantage of Web custom formats. The [copyaudio.js](./demo/copyaudio.js) script is a userscript (written for Violentmonkey) that copies any currently playing audio to the clipboard.
